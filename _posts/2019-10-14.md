I've spent the past few days struggling with object detection. I've determined that the difficulty is arising more from my lack of basic Python skills than the actual machine learning. I considered switching the project into Matlab, but I decided this would be counterproductive since I am likely to use more Python in the future. I'm going back to basics to brush up on Python.
